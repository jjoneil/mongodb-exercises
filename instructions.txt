Instructions for running these exercises.

Code commands are given in backticks. Run the commands without the backtick characters.

1. Open the project folder in terminal and execute `npm i`

2. Create a new folder inside the project folder called `data`

3. Run `mongod --dbpath ./data`
	(You might want to run this in a new terminal - just make sure you're inside the project folder.)

4. Run (only once!) `node import.js`
	(If you run this more than once, kill mongo, run `rm -rf ./data` and go back to #2.)

5. Run the server by executing `node exercises.js`.
	(The output for these problems will log to the terminal - there's no webserver here.)

6. Solve the problems in exercises.js - you'll have to edit the imported files.

7. Turn this all in via github!

Notes on the aggregation pipeline

-collection is our reference to collection in the database

-db.collection("hats") sets up an object in our local js

-collection.aggregate([{}]) : sets up aggregation pipeline

-the array is the aggregation pipeline

-send objects (by putting them in the pipeline)

-aggregation pipeline command starts with a dollar sign

-aggregation pipeline stage is an object containing the command as a key, and any options as the value
	ex: {$sort: {value: 1}}
